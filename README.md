# **Natural Language Processing with CNN**
- I will update this Notebook each day. It is not completed yet. I hope you will understand all the Code snippets and it's Implementation of today's Snapshot. I have presented with proper Documentation.

Convolutional neural network (Convolutionl Neural Network, CNN) is a multiple-layer neural network method to learn hierarchical characteristic of data. In recent years, CNN has developed rapidly in the design and calculation of natural language processing (NLP).
